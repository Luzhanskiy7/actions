@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_get_products(client):
    response = client.get('/api/products')
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_get_product(client):
    response = client.get('/api/products/1')
    assert response.status_code == 404

# Add more tests for other endpoints and functionality

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pytest.main()

In this example, we've defined two simple unit tests using the pytest framework. We create a fixture called client to get a test client for the Flask application, which allows us to send HTTP requests and receive responses.

The test_get_products and test_get_product functions are examples of test cases for the respective routes. You should add more tests for other routes and functionalities in a similar manner.

To run the tests, you can use the following command in the terminal:

bash

pytest test_app.py

Make sure you have pytest installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

bash

pip install pytest

Remember to adjust and expand the tests based on the specific behavior and requirements of your application.
